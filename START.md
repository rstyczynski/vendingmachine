To start copy/paste below prompt to Claude Code in repository with `backlog`, and `plan` files as defined by RUP Strike Back.

```
Work on this directory / project as main goal, by using agentic instructions and files from RUPStrikesBack project.

What have to be done is defined in `backlog.md` with iterations defined in `plan.md`.

How to proceed - all instructions, rules, etc. are taken from RUPStrikesBack. Add RUPStrikesBack `https://github.com/rstyczynski/RUPStrikesBack.git` as a submodule, refresh if needed (git submodule update --remote), and run `@RUPStrikesBack/.claude/commands/rup-manager.md`.
